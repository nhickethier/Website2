     <p> Cheeseburgers is one of my favorite foods<br>
      The meat and chesse is the main appeal and tastes soooo good with onions and lettuce <br>
      I don't however like going to fast food places to get my fix of burgers

       <br>
       <p>Turkey is one of my favorite deli meats  <br>
        For most chicken is the better white meat but to me its turkey <br>
        Whether from albertsons or subway it is my favorite lunch meat <br>

        <p>Cheese is my favorite condemints for almost anything  <br>
        The savory flavor tastes so good and goes with so many foods<br>
        Mac & Chesse and cheese dip are two of my favorite uses of it<br>
