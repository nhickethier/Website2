     <p>I feel I am very much a dog person and I have two dogs at my house <br>
      Koda and Kenai are the names of my two dogs named after the main characters from Brother Bear <br>
      Kenai is my hyper yellow lab who is a big pest beast<br>
      Koda is my big black lab who is basically a big marshmellow

       <br>
       <p>Foxes are one of my favorite animals  <br>
         I love the book <i>The Little Prince</i> and the movie <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i><br>
         The shade of red on their fur is very pleasing to the eye

        <p> As a family I often watch shark week when it shows on the Discovery Channel <br>
        The sharks are so interesting and spending the whole week learning about them is so cool<br>
        Jaws and The Meg are two great Movies<br>
      <b>  Sharknado does not count</b>
